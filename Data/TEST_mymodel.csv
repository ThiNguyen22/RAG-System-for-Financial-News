  VFG's net revenue increased by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year.
 
  ### Explanation:
 
  To determine the percentage increase in VFG's net revenue, we need to compare the net revenue figure for the first quarter of 2024 with the net revenue for the same period last year. The context provides the following figures:
 
  - First quarter of 2024: Net revenue of VND 1,119 billion
  - First quarter of 2023: Net revenue of VND 1,025 billion
 
  To calculate the percentage increase, we use the formula:
 
  `Percentage Increase = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value * 100`
 
  Plugging in the values, we get:
 
  `Percentage Increase = (1,119 billion - 1,025 billion) / 1,025 billion * 100`
 
  `Percentage Increase = 94 billion / 1,025 billion * 100`
 
  `Percentage Increase = 9.2%`
 
  Therefore, VFG's net revenue increased by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year.://"

 \[ \text{Percentage of Ownership} = \frac{2,900,000}{\text{Total Shares}} \]

This trend has been noted despite the overall improvement in exports. The prices of foreign oil and exports have seen a particularly sharp increase over the last few months. Specifically, the average export rice price in April reached 619 USD/ton, which continued to decrease by 2% compared to the previous month but increased by 18.3% over the same period last year.

  According to the monetary policy as of May 6-10, 2024, Fed President Raphael Bostic commented that inflation may slow down. He indicated that the central bank could start lowering interest rates by 2024. However, he also noted that any rate cuts might only be by a small margin, such as 0.25 percentage points, and only in the final months of the year. 
 
  Mr. Bostic was pleased with the cooling of core inflation in April 2024, but emphasized the need to closely monitor the data in the following months to ensure that core inflation does not increase again. He reiterated that the Federal Reserve had already tightened policy sufficiently to bring inflation to the target of 2%.
 
  In summary, Mr. Bostic suggested that the Fed could start lowering interest rates in 2024, but the rate cuts would be gradual and cautious, with a focus on ensuring that inflation remains under control.://"

  The USD price dropped sharply on the morning of May 16 due to several factors:
 
  1. **Cooling of US Inflation**: The release of April 2024 US inflation data showed a slight cooling, which led to expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) might relax its monetary policy soon.

  - **Strong recovery of the USD in the third quarter of 2023:** The strong recovery of the dollar in the previous quarter made it more vulnerable to a sharp decline as it weakened its role against other currencies like the Chilean peso and nearly 8% against the Hungarian forint.
  - **Inflation-reducing rate of inflation:** A reduction in inflation rates led to a decrease in the demand for safe-haven currencies like the dollar, leading to its fall.
 
  Therefore, the main reasons for the dollar's strong fall from May 13-17, 2024, include the cooling down of inflation, the strong recovery of the dollar in the previous quarter, and the reduction in inflation rates, which collectively weakened its demand and led to a significant decline in its value.://"
