 ### Relevance of the Question and Passages:
 
 The question asks for the list of 10 hot stocks under the Vietstock PTKT angle of view. Each passage provides a different list of 10 hot stocks, but they are not consistent with each other. The passages are relevant as they all discuss lists of hot stocks under the Vietstock PTKT perspective, but they provide different sets of stocks.
 
 ### Brief Answer Based on the Passages:
 
 Given the inconsistencies among the passages, the most straightforward approach is to consider the stocks that appear most frequently across the passages. The stocks that appear in at least three of the passages are:
 
 - DPM
 - TCB
 - TPB
 
 These stocks are mentioned in all five passages, indicating they are consistently considered hot stocks under the Vietstock PTKT angle of view. However, since the question asks for a list of 10, and the passages provide conflicting information, it is challenging to provide a definitive list of 10 stocks without further clarification from the source.
 
 ### Conclusion:
 
 The most frequently mentioned stocks across the passages are DPM, TCB, and TPB. For a complete and accurate list of 10 hot stocks, further clarification from the Vietstock PTKT source would be necessary."

 ### Relevance of the Question and Passages:
 
 The question asks for the percentage growth in profit before tax after the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The passages provide various financial metrics, including earnings before tax and net income, but only Passage 4 directly mentions the pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 2023.
 
 ### Relevant Passage:
 
 - **Passage 4** is relevant as it provides the pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 2023, which is 1.588 billion.

 Given the information available:
 
 - Pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 2023: 1.588 billion (Passage 4).
 
 Without the pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 2022, we cannot calculate the percentage growth. Therefore, additional information is required to provide a precise answer."

 The phrase ""the first trading session of the second trading session of the second trading"" appears to be a complex, nested description of trading periods. It likely refers to a specific segment within a series of trading sessions, but without additional context, it is difficult to provide a precise explanation. The phrase suggests a hierarchical structure where trading sessions are subdivided into smaller sessions, and the ""first trading session"" is a part of the ""second trading session"" within this hierarchy."

 ### Relevance of the Question and Passages:
 
 - The question asks about the total land area transferred by UBND Pyongyang Province to the Company for a project.
 - Only Passage 1 is relevant as it provides specific details about the land area transferred.
 - Passages 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not provide relevant information regarding the land transfer.
 
 ### Brief Answer Based on Passage 1:
 
 The total land area transferred by UBND Pyongyang Province to the Company for the project includes:
 - 212,992 mÂ²
 - 94 acres (map number 16)
 - 53 acres (map number 17)
 - 92 acres (map number 24)
 
 To provide a single total land area, we need to convert all measurements to a common unit. Assuming 1 acre = 4,046.86 mÂ²:
 
 - 94 acres = 94 * 4,046.86 mÂ² = 380,404.84 mÂ²
 - 53 acres = 53 * 4,046.86 mÂ² = 214,484.58 mÂ²
 - 92 acres = 92 * 4,046.86 mÂ² = 372,313.12 mÂ²
 
 Adding these to the 212,992 mÂ²:
 
 Total land area = 212,992 mÂ² + 380,404.84 mÂ² + 214,484.58 mÂ² + 372,313.12 mÂ²
  = 1,180,195.54 mÂ²
 
 Therefore, the total land area transferred is approximately 1,180,195.54 mÂ²."

 The question asks about the amount CTCP Sonadezi Long ThÃ nh will receive with the provisional dividend of the first tranche of 2023. Only Passage 1 is directly relevant to this question as it provides specific information about the dividend amount and the number of shares in circulation for CTCP Sonadezi Long ThÃ nh. The other passages discuss dividend-related dates and figures for other companies or general financial information, which are not relevant to the question.
 
 ### Brief Answer Based on Passage 1:
 
 CTCP Sonadezi Long ThÃ nh will receive a provisional dividend of 1,200 VND per share for the first tranche of 2023. With over 18.2 million shares in circulation, the total amount received can be calculated as follows:
 
 \[ \text{Total Dividend} = 1,200 \, \text{VND/share} \times 18,200,000 \, \text{shares} = 21,840,000,000 \, \text{VND} \]
 
 Therefore, CTCP Sonadezi Long ThÃ nh will receive 21.84 billion VND with the provisional dividend of the first tranche of 2023."

 Given the inconsistencies and the more conservative estimate in Passage 3, the projected credit growth for the entire banking system by the end of the first quarter of 2023 is likely to be lower than initially forecasted in Passage 1."

 - Dividend per share: VND 3,000
 - Total shares: 15.2 million
 
 To calculate the total investment:
 \[ \text{Total Investment} = \text{Dividend per Share} \times \text{Total Shares} \]
 \[ \text{Total Investment} = 3,000 \, \text{VND} \times 15,200,000 \, \text{shares} \]
 \[ \text{Total Investment} = 45,600,000,000 \, \text{VND} \]
 
 Therefore, Vicasa Steel will invest **VND 45.6 billion** to distribute the dividend to its current shareholders."

 ### Relevance of the Given Question and Passages:
 
 - **Passage 1** is directly relevant as it provides the expected profit before tax for 2022.
 - **Passages 2, 3, 4, and 5** are not relevant to the question as they discuss different years or unrelated financial metrics.
 
 ### Answer Based on Relevant Passage:
 
 To determine the percentage increase in profit before tax for 2022 compared to 2021, we need the profit before tax for 2021. However, the passages provided do not include the profit before tax for 2021.
 
 Given the information from Passage 1:
 - Expected profit before tax in 2022: 102 billion VND.
 
 Since the profit before tax for 2021 is not provided in the passages, we cannot calculate the percentage increase directly from the given information.
 
 ### Conclusion:
 
 Without the profit before tax for 2021, it is impossible to calculate the percentage increase for 2022. Therefore, additional information is required to answer the question accurately."

 2. **Passage 2:**

  - No specific figures or comparison to 2022.
 
 3. **Passage 3:**
  - Provides specific figures for the third quarter of 2023:
  - Net profit: 178.03 billion VND (a decrease of 12.5% from the same period).
  - After-tax profit: 40.2 billion VND (a decrease of 23.4% from the same period).
  - No annual comparison to 2022.
 
 4. **Passage 4:**
  - Details the 2023 non-stock-sharing plan:

 ### Relevance of the Given Question and Passages:
 
 - The question asks for the percentage decrease in post-tax profit projected for 2023 compared to 2022.
 - Passages 1, 2, and 5 do not provide relevant information regarding the annual post-tax profit comparison.
 - Passage 3 provides quarterly data but not annual projections or comparisons.
 - Passage 4 provides the projected post-tax profit for 2023 but does not provide the 2022 post-tax profit for comparison.
 
 ### Answer Based on Passages:
 
 Since none of the passages provide the 2022 post-tax profit figure, it is impossible to calculate the percentage decrease based on the provided information.
 
 ### Direct Answer Without Considering Passages:
 
 To determine the percentage decrease in post-tax profit for 2023 compared to 2022, we need the post-tax profit figures for both years. Given the 2023 projected post-tax profit of 680 billion VND, if we had the 2022 post-tax profit, we could use the formula:
 
 \[ \text{Percentage Decrease} = \left( \frac{\text{Post-tax profit in 2022} - \text{Post-tax profit in 2023}}{\text{Post-tax profit in 2022}} \right) \times 100 \]
 
 Without the 2022 post-tax profit figure, the exact percentage decrease cannot be determined."
